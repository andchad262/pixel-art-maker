# Pixel Art Maker

This is a basic pixel app for the Udacity Front End course. The app met specifications with the ability to change the number of rows and columns. Also the app has the ability to change the pixels to basic colors. As of this update, I have not added the ability to change the pixels with custom colors.

You can demo the app here https://codechad.github.io/pixel-art-maker/
